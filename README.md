## Problem

- People struggle to find time to hand wash their cars.  Automatic car washes are expensive and can often damage cars with heavy brushes and harsh chemicals.
- A lot of people are looking to make an honest extra buck.  But they'd like to work outside and do something with their hands.
- Contractors want to have a flexible schedule and set their own rates.

## Mission

A . Let customers hire a car washer that they like and trust (based on the car washer's profile and cost) to come to them and wash and/or detail their cars.  

B.  Let people become paid car washers by creating a profile that customers can view.

C. Allow customers to hire car washers and facilitate and manage the transaction.

D. Allow customers and car washers to rate and leave feedback about each other.
